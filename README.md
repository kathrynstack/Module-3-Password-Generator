# Module-3-Password-Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivaton for making this password generator was to apply the skills I have learned with Javascript, and create a functional Password Generator. 
I built this project to create a password generator that would function as tool for creating a secure password that required multiple criterias, testing my javascript knowledge.
This Password Generator solved the problem of not having to create your own secure password, and relying on a tool to do it for you.
I learned how to apply different javascript properties like a while and for loop, as well as prompts and functions to make a useful tool.
